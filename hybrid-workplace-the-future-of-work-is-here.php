                            <p>Yes, it is happening! The corporate work space is not confined by multi-storey buildings or central AC rooms anymore. Now it resides in corners and places which were unimaginable a year ago. Homes are the new work stations. Zoom, Google Meet, MS Teams and Webex are the new meeting and conference rooms. With all of us learning to adjust to living with the pandemic and its long-term repercussions, it was only a matter of time for the concept of Hybrid Workplace to be born.

                            <h4 class="single-blog-grid-text">SO WHAT IS A HYBRID WORKPLACE?</h4>
                            <p>
                                Hybrid Workplace is both a futuristic concept and a need of the hour model that allows the employees of an organisation to come to office occasionally and finish the rest of the work from home. The idea of Hybrid Workplace is to empower organisations to work smoothly and efficiently, while keeping its employees safe. It is an ideal model that blends office and home working and offers many benefits to organisations and employees alike. And the more important question here is – are you ready and equipped to implement the idea?

                            <p>
                                The concept of Hybrid Workplace is equally rewarding for organisations as well as its employees. It is totally unbiased, helps all parties involved in equal measure and opens a new door that leads to both personal and professional growth. Here are the five most important reasons to consider while making plans to become a Hybrid Workplace.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p><b>Reduced operational costs:</b> Less usage of office facilities leads to decreased costs.</p>

                                <p><b>Increased productivity:</b> Employees become more focused and accountable and work better.</p>
                                
                                <p><b>Greater work-life balance:</b> Employees manage their time better and maintain balance between work and personal life.</p>
                                
                                <p><b>Future ready:</b> It prepares organisations for lockdown situations that may arise in the future without compromising on work and output.</p>
                                
                                <p><b>More safety:</b> When people stay home more, they stay safe from the contagious virus.</p>

                            <p>
                                Any organisation can become a Hybrid Workplace. All it takes is a few steps and the willingness to adapt to this change. Here’s the process:
                            </p>
                            
                            <p><b>Prepare for the transition:</b> Make a proper plan, lay down new processes, revise short and long-term objectives, delegate new roles and decentralize the work.</p>

                            <p><b>Redefine goals:</b> Reshape organisational, team and individual goals and convey them to each employee.</p>

                            <p><b>Involve employees:</b> Take inputs and suggestions from employees, make them feel involved and safe.</p>

                            <p><b>Communicate plans:</b> Describe everything important and related to everyone so they are on the same page.</p>

                            <p><b>Invest in required systems:</b> Buy the latest tools needed to make a successful Hybrid Workplace.</p>

                                Now, becoming a Hybrid Workplace is easy. But the real challenge lies in becoming a Hybrid Workplace that turns into a successful model. One that will inspire others to follow suit. Taking care of work from home is not an easy task. With skilled and responsible employees, scattered across remote spaces, it also demands tools that make things easier, better and smarter.
                            </p>
                            <p>So, invest in Cisco products! They are perfect and suitable for both office and home usage.
